## Description

This project contains an implementation of a fan controller application for AVR platform using Atmega32 microcontroller. It utilizes LCD, DC motor, LM35 temperature sensor, ADC, and timers to control the speed of a fan based on the temperature readings obtained from the LM35 sensor.

## Features

- Automatic fan speed control based on temperature.
- Real-time temperature display on LCD.
- Fan speed control using DC motor.

## Requirements

- AVR development board with Atmega32 microcontroller.
- AVR toolchain.
- AVR programmer.
- LM35 temperature sensor.
- DC motor.
- LCD display.

## Usage

1. Connect your AVR development board to your computer.
2. Compile the code using your AVR toolchain.
3. Upload the compiled binary to your AVR development board using an AVR programmer.
4. Power on your AVR development board.
5. Monitor the temperature reading and fan speed on the LCD display.
6. The fan speed will automatically adjust based on the temperature.
